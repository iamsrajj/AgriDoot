## Overview

Agriculture has been the backbone of human civilization, but modern challenges like erratic weather patterns, imprecise resource allocation, delayed disease detection, and limited access to agricultural knowledge have hindered farmers' productivity. AgriDoot is here to change that.

## How AgriDoot Works

AgriDoot is a multifunctional IoT (Internet of Things) device installed on farmland. It collects real-time data on crop-specific atmospheric and soil parameters, which is sent to a cloud server for analysis. Proprietary algorithms then provide personalized recommendations to farmers through a mobile app.

## Key Benefits

1. **Precise Resource Allocation:** AgriDoot ensures resources like water, fertilizers, and pesticides are used efficiently, enhancing crop productivity.

2. **Advanced Weather Monitoring:** Farmers receive accurate and localized weather information, helping them make informed decisions on planting, irrigation, and crop protection.

3. **Comprehensive Crop Monitoring:** AgriDoot tracks crop health, growth, and soil parameters in real-time, enabling early disease detection and improved yields.

4. **Image-Based Disease Detection:** The mobile app allows farmers to detect plant diseases by capturing images of affected plants, providing instant customized remedial suggestions.

5. **Knowledge Sharing Hub:** AgriDoot fosters collaboration among farmers and experts, offering access to advice, insights, and data-driven recommendations.
